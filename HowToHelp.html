    <h1>How You Can Help</h1>
    <p>&nbsp; Do you know what the acronym LGBTQIA+ means? It stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersexual, and asexual. The plus stands for the increasing diversity of gender and sexual identity. People who identify as any of the above-mentioned things do exist, and they do matter. They commonly face struggles in life due to the way they identify. We need to fix this problem, and YOU can help.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp; The main way you can help is to support these people. Do not try to make them embarrassed or guilty because of who they are, and do not let the people around them do that either. When you meet someone do not automatically assume their pronouns. If they are not wearing a nametag that clearly states their gender identity, ask before assuming they are he/she/they.   
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp; If you know someone who is LGBTQIA+, you can ask them how they identify, why they identify themselves that way, and what it means to be an LGBTQIA+ person. But keep in mind that they arenâ€™t different from normal people in any way, except that they think and feel different than us.
